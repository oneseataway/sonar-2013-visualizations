Sónar 2013 Visualizations
=========================

data visualizations of various Barcelona city data-points for display during Sónar 2013. These visualizations accompany the physical experience of "One Seat Away" (https://oneseataway.tumblr.com/)


Loading
---------

The visualization can be ran locally via a very basic Node.js implementation, in terminal enter:

```
$ node node_server.js 9000
```

simply load http://localhost:9000/index.html in your (webkit) browser of choice. In order to shut the Node.js server down, toggle back to terminal and hit ```ctrl+c```.


Components
---------
The visualization primarily runs on (a currently unofficial fork of) Paper.js (https://github.com/frederickk/Paper.js)

As well as frederickkPaper (https://github.com/frederickk/frederickPaper) which extends Paper.js functionality.
